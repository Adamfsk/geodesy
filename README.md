Libraries of geodesy functions implemented in JavaScript

latlon.js
---------

This is a library of geodesy functions for working with points and paths on (a spherical model of) the Earthâ€™s surface, including (orthodromic) great-circle geodesics and (loxodromic) rhumb lines. All calculations are done using spherical trigonometry.

The library includes the following functions:
- distanceTo (using haversine formulation)
- bearingTo
- finalBearingTo
- midpointTo
- destinationPoint
- intersection (of two paths)
- rhumbDistanceTo
- rhumbBearingTo
- rhumbDestinationPoint
- rhumbMidpointTo
